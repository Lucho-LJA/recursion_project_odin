# project Odin: recursion
Odin project about recursion
## Instructions
The project have 2 ruby files in lib folder. To run you must follow the next steps
    - Clone the repository on local machine
    - Locate in the root of cloned folder (Terminal)
    - FIBONACHI --> Run comand: ruby ./lib/fibo.rb
    - MERGESORT --> Run command: ruby ./lib/merge_sort.rb
## Description
### Fibonachi
Script where exits 2 diferent methods to obtain the fibonachi serie as array
    - #fibs is a traditional solution using iteration
    - #fibs_rec is a solution with recursion
The script prove the same number to verify the both solution
### Merge Sort
Script where there are 2 methods to sort a array ascending
    - #merge_sort is the principal method that have the recursion to divide the array for the middle
    - #merge is the method to compare the split arrays to sort them in one
